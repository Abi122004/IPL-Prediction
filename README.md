# IPL Match Winner Prediction (2025 Edition)
This project leverages machine learning to predict the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. By analyzing historical match data, team statistics, and match conditions, the model provides probabilistic predictions for match winners. The application features both Python and R implementations, offering flexibility and robustness.‚Äã
